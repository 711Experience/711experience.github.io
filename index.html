        <em>The 7/11 Experience</em> was originally produced as a series of text posts (and one SoundCloud audio file) on the Discord server HTwins Central. It documents the events of and surrounding the 11th of July, 2017. While some context is provided in the text itself, it may be of help to consider the following additional information:<br /> HTwins Central is the official Discord server following the various projects of the HTwins, <a href="https://twitter.com/realcarykh">Cary</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/fernozzle">Michael</a> Huang, in particular their series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL24C8378F296DB656">Battle for Dream Island</a>, currently in its fourth season, Battle for BFDI, or BFB. The server is currently home to over 5000 fans of the pair and can be accessed <a href="https://discord.gg/ShP2hbT">here</a>.

            It's September 2016. Dawthon is ousted from his position as server owner and Spicyman33 is promoted to the role. This would be the start of the longest reign of a server owner to date.

            It's November 2016. Several staff and a group of apparently likeminded people form a secret group DM, unbeknownst to the dissenters. The group will eventually be labelled "Another Brick in the Wall" although it will later be informally abbreviated to "Brick chat". From here, without the knowledge of the whistleblower, the group will monitor the server the dissenters are operating out of.<br> Moderator applications are also discussed. Back in staff discussion, tempers flare over a controversial candidate. The candidate will be selected, although not in a way that pleases anyone involved. This is not important to the story as a whole, but should help to provide some small amount of context.<br> The whistleblower leaks the staff discussion channel contents and is removed from their post shortly, thereafter. This, too, is not important to the story.<br> Snap back to the present.<br> On another server, Tantusar is consoled by a circle of equally angry friends.

            It's November 2016.<br> GreenTree never wanted the applications to go ahead. He only scored the final few.<br> Tantusar tried to be sensible.

The process had been completed only marginally better than that which selected Joseph Howard as a moderator.

            It's 2017. For several months, Asha does nothing. When she does speak it is only to apologise for her “poor internet connection” from “the Seychelles.” The concept of removing inactive moderators from their posts is brought up a few times but never taken seriously. The most that goes to vote is automatically abstaining them from votes, which passes. Nobody suspects a thing, because why would anyone ever suspect anything on a server for kids, by kids, about a set of channels with kids as a primary demographic?<br> Snap back to the present.<br> Nobody suspects a goddamn thing. There are bigger fish to fry than somewhat lacking staff. Who even cares, right?<br> Honestly, it means about as much to anyone as retrospectives on the circumstances that led to a tragedy.<br> It's the 9th of July, 2017, 4:06AM PDT. There are two days.
